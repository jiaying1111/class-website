        <h2>About and Me</h2>
        <p>
            2025 has felt like a year of transition. As I think about graduation and what comes
            after, I’ve been paying closer attention to my thoughts, emotions, and working process.
            This website is a quiet record of that time, collecting moments of uncertainty, focus,
            rest, and change—organized alphabetically rather than chronologically, as a way to notice
            how the year actually felt.

        <h4>1. Anxiety</h4>
        <p>
            Thoughts about graduation, my portfolio, and what comes after school appeared more
            frequently, sometimes without clear reasons. I remembered there were many 2 a.m. nights
            when I stared at social media, looking at other people’s lives. What kind of life will I
            be living in five years?
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>2. Bold</h4>
        <p>
            It showed up in small decisions—continuing to work despite doubt, sharing ideas
            before they felt fully formed, and choosing to move forward without clear answers.
            Being bold often meant acting first and understanding later.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>3. Cry</h4>
        <p>
            I learned not to cry too much this year, though I’m not sure whether that means I
            became stronger or simply more practiced at holding things in.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>4. Daydream</h4>
        <p>
            I spent more time sleeping during the day, so it was, quite literally, daydreaming.
            During the final weeks, I stayed up very late at night. The quiet helped me focus, but at
            the same time, I hated how empty it felt when it settled around me.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>5. Edge</h4>
        <p>
            I spent more time focusing on exploring different “edges” in my work. That in-between
            state feels alive to me—unstable, unfinished, and full of possibility. I love watching
            forms shift, stretch, and transform as they move across that boundary, as if they are
            still deciding what they want to become.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>6. Fuzzy</h4>
        <p>
            Many things felt fuzzy this year. Plans overlapped, emotions blurred, and directions
            were rarely clear. I often felt like I was moving without a sharp outline of where I was
            headed. I began to sit with the blur, letting uncertainty exist without immediately
            resolving it.
